  ── benilla · sound measuring mode ─────────────────────────────────────────
    Recording two mixes at once: what the game ASKED for (before the limiter)
    and what you actually HEARD (after it). One file cannot tell those apart;
    two can, and that is the whole question.

    ▶ PRESS F9 THE MOMENT YOU HEAR IT.
      That stamps the exact sample. Without a mark I am scanning ten minutes
      of audio guessing which second you meant; with one I read outward from
      it. Press it every time — several marks is much better than one.

    Then quit the client normally and run:  scripts/soundprobe.py
