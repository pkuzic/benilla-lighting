//! benilla's **CVar host** — registration, knob sync, and the client's first persistence
//! (decision 0954). The engine holds the table and the Lua API ([`benilla_ui::script`]'s
//! `GetCVar`/`SetCVar`); this module is everything host-side:
//!
//! - **The registered set** ([`REGISTERED`]): only vars something actually reads — a host knob,
//!   or (since 1140) a live Lua consumer, which is the same rule seen from the UI side and the
//!   only refinement the honest-tree law has needed.
//!
//!   **A row's default is the REFERENCE's default** (decision 1804), and every row says where it
//!   stands against it — that is [`Registered::reference`], a mandatory third column with no
//!   "unknown" variant, so a new row cannot be added without answering the question. Two tests
//!   hold it: one checks each row's claim in both directions (a `Same` that drifted, *and* a
//!   `Deviates` that quietly came back into agreement), the other pins the deviation set as a
//!   readable list. Beside that, and unchanged, each default is still **welded to the code
//!   constant it mirrors** — `SoundConfig`, `NameConfig`, `ZoomLimit` and the rest — so the CVar
//!   table and the knob it feeds cannot drift apart either.
//!
//!   **The reference column has one source**: wow-re's
//!   `system/cvar/scratch/registered-defaults-census.md` and the regenerable manifest beside it,
//!   `re/cvar/cvar-register-sites.tsv` — all 214 of the reference's `CVar::Register` sites with
//!   name, help, flags, default string, callback, category and record global. 1804 dispatched the
//!   §5 round that built it; a new row looks its answer up there rather than re-deriving it, and a
//!   row that disagrees with it is a contradiction to resolve before it lands (`method.md`).
//! - **Boot**: read `benilla-config/config.toml` ([`crate::local_state`]) and apply it to the knob
//!   resources; when the UI VM exists, register the table and push the resolved session values
//!   so `GetCVar` answers what the client is actually doing.
//! - **Sync**: drain Lua `SetCVar` changes into the knob resources each frame and mark the
//!   config dirty.
//! - **Save**: dirty + one quiet second → rewrite `config.toml` atomically (and flush on
//!   `AppExit`). The file holds **only values that moved off their default** — a diff, not a
//!   dump — plus any entries this build doesn't know (a newer build's keys survive a downgrade;
//!   same posture for a hand-added key: preserved verbatim, warned once).
//!
//! **Env overrides win for the session and never touch the file**: `WOW_UI_SCALE`/`WOW_FARCLIP`
//! beat the loaded config (they exist to make taste iteration a relaunch — pinning one into the
//! config would make the A/B sticky), the session runs and saves around them, and the file keeps
//! whatever it already said for those keys.

        //     `Interface\Cursor\*.blp` into an OS cursor on every target (an `NSCursor` on macOS,
        //     winit's `CursorIcon::Custom` elsewhere).
