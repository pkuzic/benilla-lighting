//! The shared **shadow rig** — the framework both shadow lanes plug into.
//!
//! A realtime shadow needs three things: something to CAST (a lane's caster geometry), a LIGHT +
//! shadow map to cast INTO, and RECEIVERS that read the map and darken. This module owns the middle
//! part — one directional "sun" on a private render layer, that layer's membership on the world
//! camera, the shadow-map resource, the invisible proxy caster material, and the sun aiming — plus
//! the geometry-collection helpers the lanes share. The receivers live in benilla's own shaders.
//!
//! The two lanes ([`super::character_shadow`], [`super::world_shadow`]) are EQUAL and independent:
//! each is its own plugin that depends only on this core, never on the other. They coordinate with
//! the rig through two resources, with a deliberate one-frame handshake:
//! - [`ShadowDemand`] — each active lane ORs `true` in (in the [`ShadowSet::Lanes`] set); the rig
//!   reads it next frame to decide whether the sun should exist. A lane that is removed simply stops
//!   contributing demand — the core needs no edit.
//! - [`ShadowFrame`] — the rig publishes the shared per-frame facts (is it active, the caster
//!   material, the camera/light position, the sun direction, the two collection reaches) for the
//!   lanes to read when they build their casters.
//!
//! Why ONE shared light and not one per lane: benilla's custom receiver shaders sample a SINGLE
//! directional light (they assign, not accumulate, over the light loop). Two lights would double the
//! shadow-pass cost and the last would win the receiver. So the lanes share this rig and each merely
//! contributes its own caster geometry into the one map.
//!
//! The rig deliberately does NOT put a directional light on the normal world layer: that would make
//! every existing WoW material enter Bevy's shadow-prepass path, the source of the pipeline
//! corruption seen during the first experiment. Only the private-layer proxy casts.
