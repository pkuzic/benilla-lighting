//! MONKEY (torch shadows, Phase 1) — the interior point-light shadow lane, a plug-in on
//! [`super::shadow_core`], independent of [`super::world_shadow`]/[`super::character_shadow`].
//!
//! **Why this is not Bevy's point shadows.** benilla's world camera sets
//! `bevy::light::cluster::ClusterConfig::None`, which disables Bevy's point/spot clustering AND
//! starves the point-light shadow-map prep — so `fetch_point_shadow` / `clusterable_objects` are
//! DEAD here. The old design (promote the nearest fixtures to shadow-casting `PointLight` proxies and
//! sample their cube maps) could never fire, so it is gone. In its place: this lane picks the
//! interior fixtures that actually LIGHT the player, computes a down-looking reverse-Z `view_proj` for each, builds the
//! retained interior caster geometry, and publishes it all as [`TorchShadowViews`] (an
//! [`ExtractResource`]). The render world then renders a depth map per fixture
//! (`benilla_world::static_gx::torch_depth`) and `static_gx.wgsl`'s interior surface lane samples
//! it so a pillar throws a radial shadow.
//!
//! **MONKEY (torch caster selection).** Which fixtures get maps used to be "the four nearest the
//! camera", recomputed and hard-switched every frame. That is the shadow POP: in Northshire Abbey
//! (42 candelabra, ~5 yd apart) the nearest-four set churns every few steps, and every fixture
//! outside it lit with no shadow at all, so a fixture's shadow appeared as you walked up to it and
//! vanished as you moved on. The selection is now (a) ranked by the fixture's own DIRECT
//! CONTRIBUTION at the player using the shaders' profile ([`fixture_score`]), (b) hysteretic
//! (a challenger must beat an incumbent by [`TORCH_SWAP_RATIO`], one swap per
//! [`TORCH_SWAP_COOLDOWN`]), and (c) CROSS-FADED — every slot carries a weight the receivers
//! `mix` with, so a promotion ramps in and a demotion ramps out before the slot is reused. The
//! budget is [`MAX_TORCH_CASTERS`] slots, of which `interiorShadowCasters` (default 12) are filled.
//!
//! Gated on `interiorLight` + `interiorShadows` ([`VideoConfig`]); declares demand so the shared rig
//! stays up. Remove this module + its plugin + the `interiorShadows` cvar and the other lanes are
//! untouched. MONKEY (static torch cache): static_gx and wow_model share the 6416-byte table.
//! Camera distance must be <= ShadowDistance, AND player distance <= 4R+3. Contribution ranking,
//! 1.5x hysteresis and fades choose up to twelve of sixteen resident slots; this is still a finite
//! budget, not a promise that a room with forty eligible candles can give all forty cube maps.
//! Rigid furniture joins the cached static geometry. Only the nearest interiorShadowDynamic
//! promoted fixtures (default four, maximum eight, measured from the player) overlay creatures/animated parts.
//!
//! MONKEY (torch lane perf): what the lane costs when nothing is happening. Three fixed per-frame
//! charges were paid regardless of every count dial — which is why `interiorShadowCasters 8` and
//! `interiorShadowDynamic 2` measured identically to the defaults — and each now has a gate:
//! the static-cache FINGERPRINT walks one slot a frame instead of four AND skips even that while
//! the scene census is unchanged ([`TORCH_SCAN_PER_FRAME`], [`PartCensus`]); the moving-caster
//! gather runs at `interiorShadowEntityRate` Hz (default 30, `0` = every frame) over each dynamic
//! fixture's OWN reach rather than the cube's 48 yd ([`entity_gather_due`],
//! [`entity_gather_radius`]); and the receivers skip the table scan where the fixture's direct term
//! is already nothing (`TORCH_SKIP_EPS`, both shaders). None of it changes what is drawn: the
//! overlay passes still run every frame from the last mesh, so a lower rate ages a POSE and never
//! removes a shadow. `WOW_TORCH_TRACE=1` prints the three counters as `torch-perf:` lines.
