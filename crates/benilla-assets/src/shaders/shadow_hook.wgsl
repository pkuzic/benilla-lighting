// benilla's receivers — `terrain.wgsl`, `wow_model.wgsl`, `static_gx.wgsl` — call `realtime_shadow`
// instead of each hand-rolling the fetch + fades. Adding or changing the realtime shadow now touches
// THIS file only; the three receiver shaders (the ones that blanked the terrain when edited by hand)
// stay untouched. The receivers keep their own downstream gating (terrain's MCSH suppression + spec
// gate, the model's interior/rig-skin exclusion + ambient-preserving apply, static_gx's ambient arm)
// — those are lighting composition, not shadow sampling, so they belong to each receiver.
//
// It is a no-op whenever no shadow sun exists: the only Bevy `DirectionalLight` benilla ever spawns
// is the shadow rig's (`benilla_app::shadow_core`), so `lights.n_directional_lights == 0` exactly
// when shadows are off, and the loop below never runs. No shader-def toggle is needed.

// peter-panning, a shadow lifting off its contact - so it is clamped at `TORCH_SLOPE_MAX * bias`.
//
// THE ARITHMETIC - and a CORRECTION to round 3's. The receivers' `TORCH_NORMAL_OFFSET` note prices
// all of this in "yards of RAY distance", which is not what `textureSampleCompareLevel` compares:
// the stored value is `ndc.z` on the cube FACE the fragment lands in, and under a perspective
// projection that is a function of the VIEW-SPACE Z - the component along the FACE AXIS - not of
// the ray length. Two things follow that the round-3 table cannot show:
//
//   · a floor directly under a fixture lands in the DOWN face, where its view-space Z is the
//     constant `h`, so its stored depth is CONSTANT across that whole face and there is no
//     gradient to clear at all - acne is impossible there. It begins the moment `r > h` and the
//     fragment crosses into a SIDE face, whose view-space Z is the HORIZONTAL distance and along
//     which the floor runs away from the eye. On a side face the gradient works out to `2A/(f*h)`
//     per unit uv (`A = near*far/(far-near)`, `f = 1/tan(fov/2)`) - i.e. it depends on the
//     fixture's HEIGHT and not at all on `r`: the same at 3 yd out as at 30.
//   · the note's normal-offset term `0.15*(h/t)` is INVERTED. Moving the sample point 0.15 yd up
//     off a grazing floor moves the place where its own shadow ray meets that floor by
//     `0.15*(t/h)` - amplified by the grazing angle, not reduced by it. So the offset is worth
//     about `(t/h)^2` times what round 3 credited it with, which is why a knee-high fixture's pool
//     was in fact clean to ~10 yd rather than to ~2.1.
//
// Re-measured exactly (scratchpad `slopebias_exact.py`: the real reverse-Z cube face, the real
// `torch_face` pick on the OFFSET point, the widened kernel's 8 taps at 3 and 6 texels, each
// SNAPPED to its texel centre, compared against the real floor plane). BREAK RADIUS = how far a
// fixture `h` yd above a flat floor lights before its own worst tap starts to fail:
//
//     h (yd)      before        after
//     4.0         clean         clean        a chandelier, a lamppost head
//     3.0         clean         clean        a WALL TORCH - always was fine, and stays fine
//     2.0        25.8 yd        clean        a brazier
//     1.5        14.1 yd        clean
//     1.0        10.1 yd        clean        the IMP's hand flame - the reported case
//     0.5         7.3 yd        clean        a candle standing on the floor
//     0.25        7.1 yd       11.7 yd       CLAMPED - see below
//
// "clean" = no tap fails anywhere out to the projection's usable 46 yd, i.e. the acne is GONE and
// not merely pushed outward. Where a tap was already passing the margin simply widens, at h = 1 yd:
// +3.5e-4 -> +2.3e-3 at r = 9, +1.7e-3 -> +3.6e-3 at r = 5; and where it was failing, -5.1e-4 ->
// +1.5e-3 at r = 15. The h = 3 wall-torch rows move 1.0x-2.7x in the same direction and never
// change verdict, which is the "forge floor unchanged, still attached at contact" requirement.
//
// The BLOCKER SEARCH matters as much as the taps. At h = 1, r = 15 its own 3-texel taps were
// self-detecting (-5.1e-4). That darkens nothing, but it hands `TORCH_PCSS_K` a blocker ratio made
// entirely of bias error - a pool going soft with nothing in it. Corrected: +1.5e-3.
//
// WHY 4 AND NOT MORE. The correction the outermost tap WANTS is 2.8e-3 at h = 1 and 6.8e-3 at
// h = 0.5, against the `4*bias` = 4e-3 ceiling: free at h = 1, clamped at h = 0.5 - and clamped is
// still enough there (+3.5e-3 at r = 9). It only falls short under a QUARTER-yard fixture, a light
// effectively lying on the ground, where the surface is near-edge-on to it, `max(N.L, 0)` has
// already taken the term toward zero, and refusing to move further is the conservative answer. A
// TILTED receiver wants LESS, not more (2.7e-4 at 45 deg, 3.0e-4 at 75 deg: the face pick swings
// back to the DOWN face and the gradient collapses), so raising the ceiling would buy nothing

//   - `view_proj`  the fixture's down-looking reverse-Z matrix.
//   - `layer`      which array layer (fixture index) to sample.
//   - `world_pos`  the receiving fragment's world position.
//   - `normal`     MONKEY (slope bias): the receiving surface's world-space normal, used ONLY to

//                  slope term off, leaving the constant bias exactly as it was. Callers pass the
//                  SAME normal they already offset `world_pos` along (`TORCH_NORMAL_OFFSET`), so
//                  the offset point and the plane through it agree by construction.
//   - `depth_tex`/`comp`  the group-3 depth array + `GreaterEqual` comparison sampler.
//   - `bias`       reverse-Z receiver bias (nudges the compare ref up to kill self-shadow acne).
//                  MONKEY (slope bias): still a CONSTANT floor under every tap - the slope term is
//                  added on top of it per tap, never in place of it.
//   - `soft`       MONKEY (torch caster selection): the BASE PCF tap-radius scale
//                  (`interiorShadowSoft`, 0.5..3, carried in the table's `count.y` LOW half as
//                  `soft x 100`). The four taps sit at ±0.5 texel × this; 1 is the historical
//                  half-texel box. MONKEY (pcss): it is now the radius at a CONTACT (a receiver
//                  touching its blocker) — the contact-hardening search below grows it with the
//                  blocker distance, so `soft` sets how sharp the sharpest edge in the scene is
//                  and every penumbra scales off it.
//   - `fade`       MONKEY (outdoor torch shadows): WHICH far fade ends the shadow.
//                  **Negative = the interior/legacy behaviour, bit-for-bit** — the reverse-Z
//                  far-plane fade computed from `ndc.z` below. Zero-or-positive = the CALLER's own
//                  fade weight, used verbatim (0 = no shadow left, 1 = full strength).
//
//                  Why an override at all: the projection is near/far `0.1/48`
//                  (`torch_shadow::cube_view_projs`), so under reverse-Z `ndc.z` is
//                  `near·(far−t)/((far−near)·t)` = **0.0079 at t = 10 yd**, which
//                  `smoothstep(0, 0.06, ·)` turns into a 5 % shadow. For a candle whose pool is
//                  3-4 yd that is a correct soft end; for a campfire whose pool is 15-25 yd it
//                  erases the shadow exactly where the shadow IS the effect. The fix cannot live
//                  in here — it wants to be a function of WORLD distance from the fixture, and
//                  this function is deliberately a pure projector that never sees the fixture — so
//                  the exterior lane computes `1 − smoothstep(0.8R, R, d)` at its call site.
// Returns 1.0 outside the frustum / behind the light; a PCF factor otherwise (0 = shadowed).
//
// MONKEY (pcss): CONTACT-HARDENING. The old kernel was one fixed ±0.5·soft texel box everywhere,
// which is why a torch beside a Darkmoon tent post threw the canvas onto the grass fifteen yards
// away as a razor-edged cut-out: a real penumbra grows with the receiver's distance FROM ITS
// BLOCKER, and a constant kernel has no way to know that distance. The three steps below recover
// it from the map itself — search for blockers, estimate how far in front of the receiver they
// are, widen the filter by that much — so a chair leg stays crisp where it meets the floor while
// the tent's edge goes soft where the canvas is metres above the grass.
//
// The blocker search reads RAW depth with `textureLoad`, not through the comparison sampler: the
// array is bound as `texture_depth_2d_array` (wgpu sample type Depth), and a Depth binding serves
// BOTH `textureSampleCompare*` (through `comp`) and an unfiltered `textureLoad` that takes no
// sampler at all — so no binding, layout or pipeline changed. That is worth insisting on, because
// the alternative approximation (infer the blocker from the FRACTION of blocked compares at two or
// three radii) only ever answers "how deep inside the shadow am I", never "how far in front of me
// is the caster", and those two differ by exactly the quantity a penumbra is made of.
//
// Cost: 4 unfiltered loads, then 4 comparison taps (the shipped kernel, unchanged) whenever the
// search finds no blocker — which is every fully-lit fragment, i.e. most of a pool — or 8 when the
// widened radius earns them. Worst case 8 compares + 4 loads per fixture per fragment.
// MONKEY (slope bias) adds NO texture read at all: ~90 ALU once per call (two crosses, two
// `mat4x4 * vec4`, a 2x2 solve) to build the receiver-plane gradient, then a dot-clamp-add — about
// 5 ALU — on each of the 4 search taps and 4 or 8 PCF taps. The gradient cannot hoist out of the
// receivers' per-fixture loop (it depends on the fixture's own face matrix), but it is bounded by
// `EXT_SEL_SHADOWED` there exactly as the taps are.

    // that gradient is the whole problem (`TORCH_SLOPE_MAX` has the measured numbers — a knee-high
    // flame's floor starts losing to it past 10 yd, a candle's past 7, and the taps that fail
    // print as faint rings out at the rim of the pool where the term is still visible). So every
    // tap gets its OWN reference, walked along the receiver's plane by what
    // that plane does over that tap's displacement: a tap sitting on the plane then compares
    // equal-to-equal and cannot fail at any grazing angle, while a tap on a real occluder is
    // untouched — the occluder is not on this plane, which is what makes it an occluder.
    //
    // `grad` is `d(ndc.z)/d(uv)` restricted to the plane through `world_pos` with normal `normal`,
    // computed ANALYTICALLY rather than from `dpdx`/`dpdy` of the ndc. Two reasons, both hard:
    //   · every call site is inside a receiver's per-fixture table scan, with data-dependent
    //     `continue`s and an early `return` (`torch_map_at`, `torch_terrain_shadow`,
    //     `torch_entity_shadow_at`) — NON-UNIFORM control flow, where WGSL's derivative-uniformity
    //     rule makes `dpdx` a diagnostic at best and a neighbouring-fixture read at worst;
    //   · screen-space derivatives are a QUAD difference, so they are wrong by construction on a
    //     two-pixel-wide sliver and along every silhouette — exactly the geometry (fence rails,
    //     chair legs, tent ropes) this lane spends its taps on.
    // The analytic form needs no quad and no uniformity, and is EXACT for a plane.
    //
    // Any two independent vectors IN the plane give the same gradient, so the tangents are left
    // un-normalised and `normal` need not be unit: only the plane's direction SPACE matters and the
    // 2x2 solve is invariant to how it is spanned. `a` picks the axis the normal is least aligned
    // with, so the first cross is never near-degenerate. A ZERO normal (the M2 corpus authors them
