// Phase 6 terrain splat shader — extends Bevy's StandardMaterial with a CUSTOM vertex + fragment stage.
//
// Blends up to 4 tiled layer textures by a per-chunk alpha map, then lights the result with WoW's
// faithful terrain lighting (fixed-function GL_LIGHTING, reproduced):
//   • DIFFUSE — `clamp(ambient_row1 + diffuse_row0·max(N·L,0) + Σ point·att·N·L)`, modulated into
//     the texture (MOD 1×). Evaluated AND CLAMPED per VERTEX (the GL T&L locus), then
//     Gouraud-interpolated — the clamp position matters once an over-gamut point light is in the
//     sum (see the `primary` varying note).
//   • SPECULAR (the bare-ground "sheen") — `clamp(row9 · pow(max(N·H,0),20)) · sheen_mask`, added
//     AFTER the texture modulate (separate-specular, LOCAL_VIEWER). The Blinn term is computed
//     PER-VERTEX (clamped per vertex, Gouraud-interpolated); the `sheen_mask` is the `_s` texture's
//     per-texel ALPHA, blended like the colour (so the sheen rides only shiny texels — stone, not
//     grass). See docs/knowledge/lighting.md
//     ⚠️ Two things bound it, BOTH needed (each was a separate blow-out): (a) per-vertex undersampling
//     of the sharp lobe (sampled only at the ~4 yd MCVT vertices, clamped, linearly smeared) vs a
//     per-PIXEL eval that saturates; (b) the `_s` alpha sheen-mask (ref mean ≈ 0.1) vs applying it at
//     a uniform 1.0 — row 9 ≈ near-white, so unmasked it washes the whole lit face to cream.
//
// Because Bevy's `VertexOutput` has no slot for the interpolated specular, we do our own (minimal)
// vertex transform and a custom IO struct, and drop `main_pass_post_lighting_processing` (fog returns
// IN-SHADER at Step 5, per docs/plans/lighting-rebuild.md — not Bevy's DistanceFog).
//
// One material serves a whole ADT tile (see terrain.rs): layer textures live in a `texture_2d_array`
// (binding 100), per-chunk alpha maps in another (104). Each merged-mesh vertex carries its chunk's 4
// layer indices in `color` (vertex COLOR) and its alpha-layer index in `uv_b.x` (UV1) — constant across
// the chunk, so interpolation lands back on the integer index.

// chunk's candidacy box (measured at the Darkmoon Faire: 12 `Free Standing Torch 01` + 3
// `General Lantern 01` within reach of the player's chunk, plus a stall lamp and the fireworks'
// spell lights). Once the candidates outnumber the slots, adjacent draw units keep DIFFERENT
// threes; and because the boundary between draw units is a straight line - an MCNK cell edge, or
// the jump from a cell-anchored chunk to the origin-anchored bench standing on it - the
// disagreement reads as a HARD STRAIGHT EDGE across a torch's pool of light (the director's
// "scars"), and as a bench lit by a firework over ground that is not. More slots make neighbouring
