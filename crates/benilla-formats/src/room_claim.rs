//! MONKEY (portal claims): **which rooms one light fixture may light** — the single rule, shared by
//! the runtime spawner (`benilla_world::terrain_stream::spawn`'s MOLT and MODD-prop lanes, which
//! turn it into the per-light claim list the room gate packs) and the offline audit
//! (`benilla-extract wmolights` / `wmolamps`, which is the only instrument that can measure it
//! across the shipped corpus). One rule, one implementation — the `fire_light` precedent.
//!
//! The gate itself lives in `static_gx.wgsl`: a WMO surface of group `G` takes an interior fixture
//! only if that fixture's claim set contains `G`. The set has three sources, in this priority:
//!
//! 1. **CONTAINMENT** — the interior groups whose authored MOGI bounding box holds the fixture.
//!    The dense supplement to the sparse MOLR relation (the Goldshire inn authors a MOLR on 2 of
//!    its 12 groups; Northshire abbey leaves 7 of 14 unnamed), ordered TIGHTEST BOX FIRST so the
//!    room a fixture actually stands in outranks the building-spanning shell that also contains it.
//! 2. **MOLR** — the groups whose authored light-ref list names the fixture. Authored for the
//!    reference's own purpose (register a GL light while drawing a visible group's doodads), which
//!    is why it cannot carry the gate alone, but it is the artist speaking and it is never wrong.
//! 2b. **SPLIT-FLOOR SIBLINGS** (MONKEY (split-floor claims)) — the group across a portal too
//!    LARGE to be a doorway ([`SPLIT_PORTAL_MIN_AREA`]): one room the artist cut in two for
//!    rendering. It joins the base at weight 1, because there is no threshold between the halves
//!    to fade across — see [`ClaimHow::Split`].
//! 3. **PORTAL-ADJACENT** — the groups up to [`ROOM_CLAIM_HOPS`] portal hops from a claimed group,
//!    when the doorways lie within the fixture's effective radius. This is the "light crosses an
//!    open doorway" rule: without it a fixture stops dead at its room's edge and a continuous floor
//!    changes brightness in a straight line at the group boundary, which is exactly the seam the
//!    owner reported. Nearest portal first, so a doorway three rooms away never takes the slot a
//!    doorway in this wall wants.
//!
//! MONKEY (soft portal claims): a portal claim is **not binary**. It carries the doorway it came
//! through ([`Claim::fade_center`]/[`Claim::fade_slack`]) and the reach left over on the far side
//! ([`Claim::fade_radius`]), and the shader turns those into a WEIGHT in `[0, 1]` — 1 in the
//! doorway, 0 where the reach runs out. That is what actually closes the seam: a binary claim
//! merely moved the step from "this room" to "the last room the hop reached", and admitting a
//! fixture on one side of a group plane while refusing it on the other is a step wherever the
//! FLOOR crosses that plane, which is precisely what a doorway is. Containment and MOLR claims
//! stay hard (weight 1) — a fixture standing in a room lights all of it.
//!
//! Sources 1+2 are the **base**: they must never be truncated (a dropped containment claim is a
//! black room, and the packer's overflow arm deliberately fails OPEN for that reason). Source 3 only
//! ever fills slots the base left free — a dropped portal claim is one doorway that does not carry
//! light, which is the behaviour we already had.

    //     it is base-equivalent in every way that matters downstream:
    //
    //     * HARD (`fade = None`): the fade exists to make a THRESHOLD continuous, and a split has
    //       no threshold. Fading across it is what put the step on the continuous floor.
    //     * hop 0, and therefore in the wavefront the portal walk seeds from below at spend 0. That
    //       is the half of this rule that closes the *second-order* seam: the inn's upstairs rooms
    //       used to reach their gallery fixtures as hop-TWO claims (through the gallery opening
    //       first), entering at the 0.2–0.5 the first fade had already decayed to, while the
    //       gallery itself held them at 1.0 — a step at every one of those doorways, the wrong way
    //       round. Re-seeded from the merged half they are hop-ONE claims entering at 1.0, which is
    //       exactly the weight the gallery side reads there.
    //     * ranked above portal claims when the six slots are contested, for the same reason
    //       containment is: this is the room the fixture is in, spelt with two group ids.
    //
    //     Transitive (the queue below re-walks each merged group), so a room cut into three merges
