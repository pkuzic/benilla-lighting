//! MONKEY (fire GO lights): **synthesising** a point light for a fire prop that authors none.
//!
//! The mechanism the reference commits — an M2 `type == 1` light block becoming a hardware
//! `GL_LIGHT` at the fixed `1/(0.7d + 0.03d²)` falloff (decision 0016) — is already parsed
//! ([`crate::M2Light`]) and already spawned by every lane. The problem is the CONTENT: a
//! client-wide sweep finds **17 of ~430** fire-ish GameObject display models authoring a light
//! block at all. `ElwynnCampfire`, `DwarvenBrazier01`, `Large/SmallFirePit01` do; every Ogre wall
//! torch, `HumanBrazierMagic`, `StormwindBrazier01`, `Forgebonfire`, every candle and every
//! `OrcBonFire*` does **not**. So a torch-lined hall is drawn by its flames and lit by nothing.
//!
//! The flame is nevertheless fully described by the model — in its PARTICLE EMITTER. The emitter
//! names a flame texture, blends additive, and carries the fire's own colour in its over-life ramp
//! ([`OverLife::color`]). This module reads exactly that and derives the light the artist did not
//! author: which emitter is the fire, what hue it burns, and how bright it should be.
//!
//! It lives in `benilla-formats` beside [`ParticleEmitterDef`] rather than in the asset layer that
//! *calls* it (`benilla_assets::m2`, where the [`crate::M2Light`] is manufactured and pushed into
//! the model's light list) for one reason: `benilla-extract`'s offline sweep — the only instrument
//! that can audit a heuristic across 430 models — is a `benilla-formats` binary and cannot reach
//! upward into the asset crate. One rule, one implementation, auditable offline and shipped live.
//!
//! **This is a synthesis, not a parse.** Nothing here is byte-verified against the reference,
//! because the reference does not do it — a vanilla client leaves those props dark. Everything a
//! synthesised light touches is therefore flagged (`ModelLight::synthetic`) so a consumer can
//! refuse it: the WMO MODD prop lane does, because a building's own MOLT fixtures already light
//! its wall torches and a second source would double them.

// caught by it. A LAMPPOST is not: `StormwindStreetlamp01`, `DuskwoodLamppost`,
// `GeneralHangingLantern01`, every `WestfallLampPost*` — none of them authors a single emitter.
// Their glow is authored as GEOMETRY: a small glass geoset carrying the M2 material render-flag
// `0x01` (UNLIT — "draw me at full texture brightness, ignore the sun"), usually with a second
// additive billboard corona card over it. So the whole street-lighting corpus — the Valley of
// Heroes, Stormwind Park, the Duskwood road — sailed straight past `fire_emitter` and lit nothing.
//
// The lamp route detects that shape. It is deliberately WEAKER evidence than a flame — an unlit
// batch says "this surface is self-illuminated", not "this object emits light" — so it is fenced
// three ways: by the model's NAME (a lamp/lantern/chandelier vocabulary), by the batch's TEXTURE
// (glow/lamp art), and by a content-family gate that keeps it out of characters, creatures, items
// and spell effects, where unlit additive geometry is the *norm* rather than a signal.
//
// The flame route always wins where both fire: it derives a real colour from the artist's own ramp,
// whereas this route can only pick a plausible one from a name (see [`lamp_color`]).

// `is_spell_path` turns every `SPELLS\` model away from both routes above, and the reason it gives
// is sound for the WORLD lane it was written for: a spell model burns for a second and vanishes,
// and a placed-scenery light table that churned at cast rate would blow its budget on nothing. But
// the *content* is exactly the same shape — an additive emitter with a colour ramp — and a
// Fireball that flies over a night road lighting nothing is the reference's own hole, not a
// decision. So the spell corpus gets its own route, with the constraints the world route lacks:
// the light is ENTITY-scoped (it lives and dies with the effect instance, never enters the placed
// lane — see `ModelLight::spell`), it is BUDGETED (the app's `SPELL_LIGHTS_MAX`), and it is
// CLASSIFIED — because only some schools of magic are LUMINOUS.
//
// That last part is the user's rule and it is a physical one: fire burns, holy light shines, fel
// fire burns green. Frost, nature, arcane and shadow do not emit — a Frostbolt is cold, Entangling
// Roots is a plant, a Shadow Bolt is the ABSENCE of light and lighting the road with it would be
// absurd. [`SpellLightKind`] is that judgement, and it is made from the model's NAME first (the
// artists named the whole corpus by school) and from the winning emitter's HUE second (the
// unnamed remainder — `Spells\Clouds8x8.blp` is the whole game's smoke and flame both).
//
// The emitter gate is deliberately WIDER than the world route's [`fire_emitter`]: a spell's flame
// art is not the `FLAMELICK`/`TORCH` vocabulary at all (a Fireball's core is `Clouds8x8`, a
// firework is `STAR5A`, Holy Light is `Clouds8x8Fade` — none of them a [`FIRE_TEXTURE_KEYS`] hit).
