//! MONKEY (swim waves) — **the CPU mirror of the ocean's vertex swell**.
//!
//! Enhanced water displaces the ocean mesh in the VERTEX stage
//! (`benilla-assets/src/shaders/enhanced_water.wgsl`, `water_swell`, called from `liquid.wgsl`'s vertex stage),
//! so the surface a swimmer floats on is not the flat MCLQ heightfield the CPU queries
//! ([`super::query::WaterChunkInfo::surface_z_at`]) — it is that heightfield plus an analytic
//! long-swell band the CPU never sees. A body positioned off the queried height therefore rides
//! *through* the crests instead of on them, which is the whole of the owner's report: the sea
//! visibly heaves and the swimmer in it does not.
//!
//! This module is the missing half: the SAME two wave components, the same dispersion, the same
//! clock, evaluated in Rust. It is a **mirror, not a second design** — every constant below is
//! copied from the shader with its line cited, and [`tests::the_table_mirrors_the_shader`] pins
//! them against the literal numbers so a drift in either direction shows up as a failing test
//! rather than as a swimmer sunk half a yard into a crest.
//!
//! **What it deliberately does not mirror.** The shader's fragment stage sums all EIGHT
//! components for its normal; the vertex stage takes `long_only` — components 0 and 1 only
//! (`enhanced_water.wgsl`), because the rest are finer than the liquid lattice can resolve and exist
//! to shade, not to move geometry. A bob driven off the fragment band would chase ripples the mesh
//! under it never made. So: two components, the mesh's own.
//!
//! **Space.** The shader's `p` is `world_position.xz` — BEVY world XZ, because the liquid meshes
//! are baked through [`benilla_assets::coords::wow_to_bevy`]. Callers pass Bevy XZ, not WoW XY.
