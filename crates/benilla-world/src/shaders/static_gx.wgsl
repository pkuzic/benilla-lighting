// MONKEY (bake floor): the SHARE OF ITS OWN MOCV BAKE that an interior-lane fragment keeps even

//
// The room lane's premise is that the bake's LEVEL is wrong — authored for a different global
// exposure, and the live fixtures decide instead. True, and it leaves a hole: a room the fixture
// table cannot reach has NO budget at all beyond `interiorAmbient`, so it renders black. The
// Lion's Pride Inn's east vestibule `g0` (the door band, box x 14.1..20.5, between the ext-class
// porch `g11` and the INT room `g1`) is the measured case — MOLR 0, ZERO fixture claims (the
// nearest fixtures are L2 at 16 yd against R 11.2 and L3 at 17.6 against R 14.7), one faded portal
// hop worth ~0.0003, so the whole budget is the bare ambient floor and the band reads 0.0194 x tex
// at the owner's cvars. The reference client has no such hole: every interior batch draws at its
// authored MOCV whether or not a light is registered, so a fixture-starved vestibule is DIM there,
// never black.
//
// What survives the lane's premise is the bake's RELATIVE statement about the room, so the floor
// is a FRACTION of it (`vc.rgb * k`), not the bake. It is added INSIDE the rolloff next to
// `enclosed_day_floor`, for the same reason that one is: it saturates with the fixtures rather
// than stacking on a lit room, so a candle-lit surface barely moves while an unlit one comes up
// off the floor. The previous attempt put the UNCAPPED bake share on the TRANS batches alone and
// produced the flat grey band this file's portal-bleed comment records (15-18 x its INT
// neighbour); a small fraction of the bake on EVERY interior batch is the other end of that trade.
//
// SCOPE — zero on an EXT-class batch of an interior group (`!class_int && !class_trans`, the
// cellar stair). The loader forces that population's MOCV alpha to 1.0 and its `vc.rgb` is the
// flat white the EXT batches carry (the extract prints `mocv rgb (255,255,255)` for every one of
// them), so a bake term there would be a full-strength WHITE lift on exactly the geometry the
// verified green-stair fix rebuilt — and there is no authored bake to restore anyway. That
// predicate is written as the two class bits rather than as `trans_a >= 1.0` because the class
// bits are what the loader actually sets; `trans_a` being 1 is a consequence. Zero as well on a
// batch with NO authored MOCV at all (`has_vc`), where `vc` is the synthetic `vec4(1.0)` default:
// there is no bake to keep a share of, and a full white `k` there would be an invention.
//
// NOT scaled by `fireLightGain` and NOT flickered: this is not a fire, it is the room's own
// authored light. The `interiorGain` scale IS applied, folded in at pack time exactly as the
// lane's other two inputs (base ambient, per-fixture fill) are — so the Dim preset dims it too and
// the shader carries no second knob.
//
// MEASURED at the owner's live cvars (`interiorGain 0.5`, `interiorAmbient 0.015`,
// `interiorFill 0.08`, `interiorExposure 2.5`, `interiorAttenScale 1.6`, `interiorDaylight 0`) at
// `interiorBakeFloor 0.12` (so `k` = 0.06), at NIGHT:
//   * `g0` one yard inside p1 (TRANS, MOCV (165,160,146) => bake 0.0377):
//       room law 0.0194 -> **0.1075** x tex; the existing 1.5x TRANS floor then displays it at
//       **0.1613** (the floor follows the raised room — it was 0.0291 before).
//   * `g1` one yard the other side (INT, MOCV (119,106,77) => bake 0.0251):
//       0.0215 -> **0.0810** x tex. Room-law ratio across the doorway 1.33x (was 1.11x); the
//       DISPLAYED ratio is 1.99x because the pre-existing TRANS floor still lifts `g0` by 1.5x.
//   * `g3`'s entry floor directly under L9 (1.52 yd, MOCV (250,164,83)): 0.5668 -> 0.6078, **+7.2 %**.
//   * a `g5` hall wall 3 yd from L0 (MOCV (146,113,78)): 0.4192 -> 0.4578, **+9.2 %**.
// i.e. both fixture-lit references move by well under the 15 % bar, and the black band does not.
// (The floor is NOT sun-gated, unlike `enclosed_day_floor`: a bake floor that vanished by day
// would black the same vestibule out at noon. Daylight therefore lifts by the same ~7-9 % on
// fixture-lit interiors, and the `g0` band by ~+20 % through the TRANS blend.)

// inward, not a uniform lift. But the shipped corpus keeps rooms whose doorway is in no table at
// all: the Goldshire inn's entry group authors no portal to its shell, no EXT-class batch, no
// vertex within half a yard of the shell that owns its threshold planks, and no localized hot spot

//     kernel depth spread  D = 6 * (t/251) * (r/h)
// while `TORCH_BIAS` in reverse-Z (near 0.1, `cube_view_projs`) is worth `0.001 * t^2 / 0.1 =
// 0.01*t^2` YARDS of separation, and this offset adds `0.15 * (h/t)` (the normal's component along
// the ray - which is exactly why it is taken along the NORMAL and not straight up: on a floor lit
// from a low angle the two agree, on a wall the vertical offset would buy nothing).
//

//        texels nearer the fixture than the biased reference, so a fraction of the 4 (or 8) taps
//        fails and the floor self-shadows. The fraction changes with the grazing angle and steps at
//        the CUBE FACE boundaries, which is what turns a round pool into a square one (and, before

//        fallen to ~36 % of its peak (`INTERIOR_CORE_GAIN/(1+(d/1.75)^2)` at d = 2.3). RESIDUAL,
//        named rather than hidden: a knee-high fixture's OUTER pool can still acne, and the honest

// anchored at the MCNK CELL so a street and the road it runs into rank the same lights and agree
// at the seam, see `wmo_exterior_point_sum`). The per-FRAGMENT shadowed term must use exactly
// THAT selection: re-ranking per fragment would put a hard line across the cobbles at every cell
// boundary, where the interpolated vertex term has none. So the vertex stage publishes its choice
// and the fragment stage only re-EVALUATES it (and shadows it).
//
// MONKEY (ext light k12) - **WHY K WENT 3 -> 8.** Three is the reference FFP's own commit limit (GL
// slots 1-3; wow-re `wmo-surface-dynamic-light` sections 4/6) and it was the right number for the
// reference's SPARSE, hand-authored light set: with two or three authored lights in a village the
// nearest three IS all of them, and no two draw units can disagree. benilla does not have that set
// - `fire_light.rs` SYNTHESISES a point light for every torch, lantern, brazier and campfire
// GameObject/doodad in range, so a lamp-lit set piece now puts 15+ exterior fixtures inside ONE
// chunk's candidacy box (measured at the Darkmoon Faire: 12 `Free Standing Torch 01` + 3
// `General Lantern 01` within reach of the player's chunk, plus a stall lamp and the fireworks'
// spell lights). Once the candidates outnumber the slots, adjacent draw units keep DIFFERENT
// threes; and because the boundary between draw units is a straight line - an MCNK cell edge, or
// the jump from a cell-anchored chunk to the origin-anchored bench standing on it - the
// disagreement reads as a HARD STRAIGHT EDGE across a torch's pool of light (the director's
// "scars"), and as a bench lit by a firework over ground that is not. More slots make neighbouring
// units AGREE, so a pool ends where the FALLOFF ends instead of where the cell does; the only open
// question is how many is enough, and the next paragraph answers it with the measurement.
//
// 8 bits per rank caps the LIVE table at 255 real entries, `EXT_SEL_EMPTY` = 255 being the
// sentinel; `global_light::MAX_LIVE_POINT_LIGHTS` enforces that CPU-side. The buffer still carries
// 256 slots, so `LightStd430` keeps its 8528 B and no mirror struct moves.
//
// MONKEY (ext light k12) - **AND WHY 8 -> 12, one round later.** Eight was MARGINAL the day it
// landed and the note here said so. The Darkmoon Faire's densest chunk holds THIRTEEN candidates
// and EIGHT of them stand strictly inside its own 33.33 yd cell, so a torch 2.5 yd outside the edge
// - lighting the grass right at the seam - cannot win a slot under any ranking, and that chunk goes
// on disagreeing with its neighbour about it. On that particular seam K=8 did not help, it made
// things WORSE (0.198 -> 0.356 of a falloff unit): raising K let the SPARSE neighbour take in
// lights the dense chunk still had no room for, so the two sets grew further apart, not closer.

//    into rank the SAME candidates and agree at the seam, which is the whole requirement.
//  · candidacy is terrain's Chebyshev box `TERRAIN_REACH`, not this file's 48 yd sphere, for the
//    same agreement reason (and because it is the byte-verified gather — see `terrain.wgsl`).
// Cost: one bounded pass over the ≤256-entry table per VERTEX (never per fragment), the same walk

//  · DIRECT — the reference's falloff × a WRAPPED Lambert, (N·L + wrap)/(1 + wrap): a hearth
//    sitting at floor level is horizontal to the floor around it, and a hard max(N·L, 0) lights
//    nothing there (the smithy only worked because its forges are raised) — times the fixture's
//    AUTHORED ATTENUATION WINDOW (MONKEY, below).
//  · FILL — a normal-free bounce, colour × K_FILL × (1 − d/reach)²: the "lamps everywhere" glow
//    Blizzard's bake carried, sourced from the room's own fixtures instead of a constant. The
//    colour is normalised for this term (the table commits RAW over-gamut colour × intensity),
//    so one hot forge doesn't wash a whole room.
// MONKEY (light lanes / interior attenuation): the loop is now over the INTERIOR half of the table
// only (colour row `.w > 0.5`), and that same `.w` is each fixture's REACH in yards — its authored
// MOLT attenuation end (M2 sources bucket by intensity), scaled live by `interiorAttenScale`. The
// reach bounds the loop, shapes the fill, and drives the direct window. `interiorAttenScale 0`
// packs the legacy 48 yd instead — under the soft profile below that is the widest, flattest pool
// the lane can make, the nearest thing left to the pre-window flat lane (it is no longer the
// byte-exact restore it was, because the window's SHAPE moved with it).
// `torch_shadow` (the #2 lane, 1.0 when no torch is promoted) shades the direct term only —
// bounce is indirect. A base ambient keeps a fixture-less nook from going black. The knobs are
// LIVE cvars packed into `point_count.yzw` — `.y` base ambient, `.z` fill gain, `.w` exposure
// (the callers' multiplier on the whole budget before the rolloff) — so

const INTERIOR_WRAP: f32 = 0.5;
// MONKEY (soft falloff): the interior pool's PROFILE — **keep this whole block byte-identical
// between wow_model.wgsl and static_gx.wgsl.**
//
// The colour row's `.w` packs each fixture's EFFECTIVE RADIUS `R`: its authored MOLT
// `attenuation_end` (an M2 source buckets by intensity instead) already multiplied by the live
// `interiorAttenScale` (default 1.6). MONKEY (pool energy): the EXTENT terms — the direct window
// and the fill span — are still written as fractions of `R`, so the cvar stays a pure zoom on how
// far every pool REACHES; the core is not, so it is no longer also a brightness dial.
//
// The RETIRED profile was the reference's `1/(0.7d + 0.03d²)` windowed by
// `1 − smoothstep(0.65R, R, d)` at `R` = the authored reach. That window closed a still-BRIGHT
// curve — 0.28 of its 1 yd value at 0.65R — over the last 35 % of the radius, i.e. a bright disc
// with a visible rim and black beyond it. That is the abbey candelabra ring. Three changes replace
// it, and the ring cannot come back because the curve is already dim wherever the window bites:
//  · CORE — `1/(1 + (d/r0)²)`: inverse square with a soft core. MONKEY (pool energy): `r0` is a
//    CONSTANT `INTERIOR_CORE_YD` **yards**, not a fraction of `R` any more. It was `0.26·R`, and
//    that tied a fixture's BRIGHTNESS to its REACH — the pool's total ENERGY grew as `R²`. The
//    Goldshire inn's `R ≈ 11-15` fixtures therefore ran a 2.1× (at 3 yd) to 2.9× (at 5 yd) hotter
//    curve than Northshire abbey's `R ≈ 7`; ten of them overlap in one room, the
//    `1 − exp(−x·exposure)` rolloff saturated, and the inn read as one flat yellow while the
//    abbey — whose pools the owner signed off — sat exactly where it should. Reach must BOUND a
//    pool, not fuel it. So the energy is now one curve for every fixture and only the WINDOW and
//    the fill span still scale with `R`: two fixtures of different reach read IDENTICALLY until
//    the shorter one's window closes. `1.75 yd` is what the abbey already had (`0.26 × 6.7` — its
//    median authored end 4.2 at the default `interiorAttenScale` 1.6), so the under-candle level
//    the exposure was tuned against is preserved to within ±10 % across the abbey's own reach
//    spread (−5 % at its median fixture) and nothing about the approved look moves.
//  · GAIN — `INTERIOR_CORE_GAIN` normalises the core against the retired hyperbolic's 1 yd value,
//    `1/(0.7 + 0.03) = 1.3699`. With a CONSTANT `r0` that normalisation is the same for every
//    fixture instead of holding only at the median reach, which is the whole point; it lands at
//    `1.5/(1 + (1/1.75)²) = 1.1308`, i.e. 0.83 × the hyperbolic — the abbey's own current level.
//    (Gain 1.817 would restore 1.3699 exactly; that is a 21 % brighter room than the approved
//    one, so it is deliberately NOT taken. Change the GAIN, never the core radius, to re-level.)
//  · WINDOW — `(clamp01(1 − (d/R)^p))²`, the UE4-style windowing: value AND derivative both vanish
//    at `d = R` (C1, so no rim), ≈1 over most of the radius, and it only ever removes energy the
//    curve has already lost.
// MONKEY (pool energy): the direct term (before the wrapped Lambert) at d = 1 / 3 / 5 / 8 / 12 yd,
// abbey-class `R = 7` beside inn-class `R = 13` —
//   was   R=7  1.152 / 0.403 / 0.164 / 0     / 0       R=13  1.379 / 0.839 / 0.470 / 0.224 / 0.033

//
// FILL keeps its EXACT form (`(1 − d/r)²`, which is `interior_window(d, r, 1.0)`) and only widens:

// 8 TRANS triangles - rendered off `benilla-extract wmolights --verts 0` at 0.05 yd with this file's
// exact interior-lane arithmetic at the owner's live cvars):
//
//   `max(room_rgb, rgb)` is evaluated PER CHANNEL, so the room law and the sunlit reference cross at
//   a DIFFERENT place in R, in G and in B. Each crossing is continuous in value and BROKEN in its
//   first derivative, and each is therefore a Mach line - three of them, at three different places,
//   with the colour stepping warmer across each (the fragments between two loci have one channel on
//   the reference and two on the room law, which is a hue no law in the shader ever asks for).
//   The BLUE locus is the reported scar: a line from the door's south jamb running diagonally into
//   the floor and dying near the middle -
//       08:20  (20.30, -1.23) -> (15.16, -4.33)   jump 0.1595/yd = 32.5 %/yd at a level of 0.491
//       noon   (19.96, -0.83) -> (15.68, -4.68)   jump 0.1594/yd = 28.6 %/yd at a level of 0.557
//   with GREEN a second, shorter line nearer the door and RED crossing only at 08:20 (which is why
//   the scar is worse in the morning than at noon). The wedge between the blue and green loci reads
//   lighter and less warm than the floor beyond it (mean 0.621 lum / R:B 1.206 against 0.415 / 1.280
//   at 08:20) - the "wedge on one side" of the report.
//   That these are TRUE C1 breaks and not the light pool's own curvature is settled by halving the
//   sample step: a break's |d2| scales as 1/h (2.25 -> 4.49 -> 8.93 /yd^2 at 0.05 / 0.025 / 0.0125 yd)
//   while a smooth arc's does not.
//
// WHY THIS SHAPE. Three laws were measured against the same floor:
//   (1) pick by LUMINANCE (one achromatic locus, all three channels switch together) - still a hard
//       C1 break, and the colour step across it gets WORSE, not better (hue step 16.7 / 20.0 against
//       the shipped 14.5 / 12.1 at 08:20 / noon): concentrating three small hue jumps into one big
//       one is the wrong direction.
//   (2) THIS - a quadratic smooth-max of half-width `TRANS_SMAX_W`. The selector disappears outright:
//       the function is C1 everywhere, so there is no locus left to draw a line at. Costs at most
//       0.0087 (08:20) / 0.0085 (noon) of display luminance against the shipped result - under 1 %,
//       and under a single 8-bit code over most of the floor.
//   (3) drop the `max` and `mix` straight to the reference - the same clean derivative, but it
//       re-opens the subtraction the `max` was added against: it renders this floor up to 0.0811 x tex
//       (11.0 %) DARKER at 08:20, 4.7 % at noon and 3.0 % at 20:00, because the room law is above the
//       reference over the whole area the p0 daylight fixture actually reaches.
//
// It OVERSHOOTS rather than undershoots, deliberately and by at most `w/4` (0.0125): a C1 function
// that equals `max` outside a band must do one or the other inside it, and undershooting would dip
// BELOW `room_rgb` - which is precisely the "the blend may only ever brighten" invariant the outer
// `max` and the night floor exist to hold. `smax >= max(a, b) >= room_rgb` still holds here.
//
// NIGHT IS BIT-IDENTICAL and not by argument: the whole selector is behind `day_w`, and
// `mix(a, b, 0.0)` is `a * 1 + b * 0` = `a` exactly, whatever `b` is. Verified numerically against the
// shipped law at `sun_w = 0` - max |difference| 0.000e+00 on every fragment of the floor.

            //     forbids that: the mix now runs between the room result and the BRIGHTER of the
            //     two, so it can add the sky's contribution and never take the room's away. This
