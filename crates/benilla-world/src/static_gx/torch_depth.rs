//! MONKEY (static torch cache): persistent six-face static maps for up to sixteen fixtures.
//! Bevy point-light clustering is disabled on the world view, so this dedicated depth lane
//! supplies both receivers. Static geometry renders only on promotion/residency/fixture changes;
//! nearest-N fixtures copy their six cached faces into a live bank and overlay moving entities.
//! With the defaults (12 resident, 4 dynamic), a steady frame records 24 copies, 24 entity draws
//! and zero static draws. At most two dirty fixtures rebuild per frame; physical slots survive
//! contribution ranking and cross-fades. See benilla_app::torch_shadow for eligibility and keys.
//!
//! **Phase 3A: the depth array is a shared `Image` ASSET**, not a render-world-owned texture. The
//! entity receiver (`wow_model.wgsl`, every unit/NPC/GameObject/interior prop) has no spare bind
//! group — a Bevy material draw sets groups 0/1/2 only — so its torch bindings ride the material's
//! own group as `Handle<Image>` + raw `Buffer` fields (`WowModelExt::torch_depth`/`torch_buf`),
//! and `AsBindGroup` resolves a `Handle<Image>` through `RenderAssets<GpuImage>`. So the image
//! ([`TorchDepthImage`]) is created ONCE at app startup in the main world (always — an absent image
//! would stall every model material's bind group and blank every model), extracted here, and BOTH
//! receivers read the same `GpuImage`: the depth node renders into per-layer views of its texture,
//! static_gx binds its D2Array view, the material binds the same view + the image's comparison
//! sampler. The 16-fixture table gets the same treatment ([`SharedTorchBuffer`]: one raw buffer,
//! rewritten in place every frame from [`TorchShadowViews`] with the SAME [`TorchTableUniform`]
//! bytes static_gx's group-3 uniform carries).
//!
//! Reverse-Z throughout (the whole engine is — `capture::depth_probe`): the depth pass clears to 0.0
//! (= far), keeps the nearest surface with `GreaterEqual`, and the comparison sampler is `GreaterEqual`
//! too. The per-fixture `view_proj` is a reverse-Z perspective built app-side in f64 (fixtures sit at
//! absolute Bevy world coordinates, ~9,300 out) and downcast to f32.

///    the retained `GxItem` holds it as an `Arc`, and the entity path's parts hold a CLONE of it.
///    Compared by CONTENT (kind + placement uniqueId + label hash) for exactly that reason — an
///    `Arc` pointer would match the retained half and never the entity half.
///  * [`Self::Instance`] — an entity-hosted light (`entities::carried_light`): a GameObject
///    brazier, a placed campfire, an NPC's torch. Those hang under the host model's FRAME entity,
///    which no `WorldObject` is available at, so the frame IS the identity and a caster part is
///    "mine" iff it is a descendant of it.
