//! The render-world half of the B1 retained pass (see `mod.rs`; decision 1429): extraction of
//! the published cell set, per-cell GPU assembly (texture-array classes + the item→layer
//! table), the pipeline family, and the draw node between the main opaque and transparent
//! passes.
//!
//! Assembly happens where each fact lives: the MAIN world bakes geometry (it owns the
//! submeshes) but cannot know texture dims/format (BLP images are `RENDER_WORLD`-only), so
//! classing into `texture_2d_array`s happens HERE, once each member's `GpuImage` is resident.
//! A cell whose textures aren't all loaded yet simply isn't drawn that frame (the entity path
//! streams batches in piecewise; cell-granular appearance is the same arrival class, mostly
//! under the load cover).
//!
//! **The arrays are ONE SHARED POOL, not per-cell (B3, decision 1432)** — `pool.rs` owns the
//! design note (the two driver taxes 1431's `sample` caught, and how dedup + drain-once +
//! sibling growth remove them structurally). Here, a re-bake costs a record table and a few
//! bind groups, never a texture.
