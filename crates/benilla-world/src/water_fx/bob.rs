//! MONKEY (swim waves) — **bodies ride the swell**: the visual-only vertical bob (and the small
//! lean into the wave slope) every swimming or floating unit takes on Enhanced water.
//!
//! Ported from WarcraftXL (https://github.com/WarcraftXL) by iThorgrim — module wxl-experimental-water, world/Ride.cpp.
//! (The principle — the authoritative position never moves — implemented independently; listed in
//! `THIRD-PARTY.md`.)
//!
//! The defect this closes is a mismatch, not a missing effect. Enhanced water heaves the ocean
//! MESH in the vertex stage ([`crate::liquid::waves`] mirrors the exact band), while every body in
//! it is placed at the height the CPU queries — the flat MCLQ heightfield, which knows nothing
//! about the swell. So the sea visibly rises and falls and the swimmer in it holds still, cutting
//! through crests. Here the two are put back on one surface.
//!
//! **Visual only, and structurally so.** The bob is written onto the unit's `Transform` in
//! `PostUpdate` *immediately before* [`TransformSystems::Propagate`] and taken off again
//! *immediately after* it — [`apply_swim_bob`] / [`clear_swim_bob`], with the pre-bob values
//! stored verbatim so the restore is exact rather than an inverse-multiply that would drift a
//! quaternion over a long float. The offset therefore exists only inside that one `PostUpdate`
//! window — nothing in `Update`, and nothing from the clear onward, can see it.
//!
//! Within the window it is visible to any *unordered* `PostUpdate` system that reads a unit's
//! `Transform` (the shadow, nameplate and billboard placements are the population), and that is
//! deliberate rather than merely tolerated: those consumers are the body's own presentation, so a
//! nameplate that rides the bob is the right answer and one that does not is the wrong one. What
//! matters is the set that must NEVER see it, and none of it is here:
//!
//! * movement, collision and the capsule run in `Update` off `player::Player::pos` and the wire —
//!   none of them read a `Transform` inside this window, and all of them overwrite it next frame;
//! * the network position is `bevy_to_wow(player.pos)`, never the body transform;
//! * the camera seat rides the pivot channel off `Player`, so the eye is NOT dragged along — the
//!   body heaves under a steady camera, which is the readable way round. (The brief allows the
//!   camera to follow at 50 %; that lives in `player/camera.rs` and is deliberately left out of
//!   this diff — nothing here can seasick-lag a view it never touches.)
//!
//! **Gates**, all four of which must hold or the offset is exactly zero:
//! 1. [`benilla_assets::WaterQuality`] ≥ 1 — Classic renders a flat sea, so a bobbing body there
//!    would be floating over nothing. The Classic path is byte-identical with this module armed.
//! 2. The surface under the body actually carries the vertex swell
//!    ([`WaterChunkInfo::has_vertex_swell`]: ADT + ocean). Rivers, WMO pools and lava are flat.
//! 3. The body is deep enough to be off the floor — the swim ramp
//!    ([`super::params::swim_ramp`], the byte-verified `0.75 · collisionHeight` line, softened
//!    into a band so a wader standing up does not pop).
//! 4. It is a body that displaces water at all ([`WorldUnit::wades`]) — which is precisely the
//!    predicate that already excludes corpses, loot and ground anchors, so "corpses and floating
//!    loot: skip" needs no second rule.
