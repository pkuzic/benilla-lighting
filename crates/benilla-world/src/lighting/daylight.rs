//! MONKEY (daylight fixtures): **the sun, as an interior-lane light, standing in the doorway.**
//!
//! THE SEAM. With `interiorLight` on, a WMO's interior groups light from the room law —
//! `interiorAmbient` + the fixtures that claim the room, and no sun (`static_gx.wgsl`'s
//! `interior_room_light`, folded through the `1 - exp(-x*interiorExposure)` rolloff). Everything
//! around a doorway does NOT: an EXTERIOR-class group (the Goldshire inn's shell), and an
//! EXT/TRANS-class BATCH of an interior group, both keep the reference sky law by day
//! (`static_gx.wgsl` ~:1242 — `day_w = {TRANS: MOCV alpha, EXT: 1} x sun_w`, blended toward the
//! reference result). So at the threshold one plank is `ambient + diffuse*N.L` and the next is
//! `interiorAmbient` — a hard line, exactly where the artists' MOCV bake used to carry the sun
//! bleed inward and the dynamic lane threw it away. At NIGHT the seam is already gone: `sun_w` is
//! 0, `day_w` collapses, and both sides are on the room law.
//!
//! THE FIX. Give the room law a sun to find: an ordinary interior-lane point light standing in the
//! doorway, coloured like the sky and calibrated so the room law's result AT THE DOOR equals the
//! reference sunlit result the batch a plank away is rendering. The seam then closes by
//! construction on both sides, and the light falls off inward the way daylight does. It rides the
//! existing machinery whole — `LightRooms` / `LightLitRooms` claims through
//! [`benilla_formats::room_claim`], `LightLane` interior, `LightReach`, the packer's soft window —
//! so nothing in the shader, the claim table or the std430 layout changes.
//!
//! WHERE A DOORWAY IS. Two seeds, and they are the client's own two populations:
//!  1. **PORTAL** — a portal whose two sides are one INTERIOR-class group and one EXTERIOR-class
//!     group (or which only one group names at all: a portal straight to the outside). This is
//!     byte-for-byte the set `FixColorVertexAlpha` (`0x6c43d0`, `benilla_formats`'s
//!     `fix_color_vertex_alpha`) whitens a group's MOCV across — "the fade is specific to
//!     interior<->exterior openings". The reference lights its dark transition corridors with
//!     exactly this relation, so it is the authored answer to "which opening lets daylight in",
//!     not a heuristic of ours.
//!  2. **APERTURE** — an **EXT-class MOBA batch of an INTERIOR group**. That is the other half of
//!     the same fact: the batch class IS the artist saying "this surface takes the full exterior
//!     day/night law", and a batch that says so inside a room is a window or an open side. It is
//!     also the population that draws the seam from the inside (the room's INT-class floor meeting
//!     its own EXT-class window wall), which no portal describes.
//!  3. **BOUNDARY** (MONKEY (daylight fixtures: boundary)) — the GROUP-LAW seam itself, taken off
//!     the meshes: the vertices an INTERIOR-class group shares (to within [`SEAM_EPS`]) with an
//!     EXTERIOR-class group of the same root. Where the artist split one continuous floor between a
//!     room and the building's shell, the two meshes are stitched along the threshold line with
//!     coincident vertices, and THAT line is the doorway — the one the inn's front door actually
//!     is, and the only one of the three seeds that can see it (there is no portal there and no
//!     EXT-class batch in the entry group; see MEASURED below). It is the exact locus of the seam
//!     rather than an approximation of it: the hard line the owner photographed IS the polygon edge
//!     where the sky law hands over to the room law.
//!
//! MEASURED, because the two seeds are not interchangeable (`benilla-extract wmolights` + a
//! batch-class dump over the same roots, 2026-09-11):
//!  * **Goldshire inn** (Lion's Pride) — 12 groups, 10 portals, and exactly ONE of them is
//!    interior<->exterior (p0, `g0 <-> g11 room04`). Its **front door is not a portal at all**: the
//!    entry group `g3` is 100 % INT-class batches with two portals, both to interior neighbours,
//!    and the shell `g4 upstairs` that holds the threshold planks authors NO portals whatsoever.
//!    The aperture seed reaches its upstairs (`g2/g6/g7/g8/g9` each carry one EXT-class batch —
//!    the windows, diag 5.4-14.9 yd), and the BOUNDARY seed is what reaches the front door: `g3
//!    entry` shares its threshold vertices with the shell `g4`, and that stitch line is the door.
//!  * **Northshire abbey** — 14 groups, 14 portals, two of them interior<->exterior (p10
//!    `g3 Main Hall <-> g5 mainlobby2`, 40.3 yd^2; p13 `g10 Stairs2 <-> g5`, 14.3 yd^2), i.e. the
//!    portal seed's own best case.
//!
//! EXCLUSIONS. A daylight fixture is NOT a fire: no [`super::FlameFlicker`] (daylight does not
//! wobble), no [`super::SyntheticFireLight`] (so `fireLightGain` cannot dim or kill it), and
//! `benilla_app::torch_shadow` skips it as a caster candidate (`Without<DaylightFixture>`) — it is
//! a 20 yd-wide area source standing in a hole in a wall, so a point-cube shadow of it would be
//! wrong in kind, and it would outrank real fixtures for the twelve cube slots.

// room whose only doorways lead to other ROOMS gets nothing from them — and with `interiorDaylight`
// defaulted to 0 (the director's call: by day light comes in at doorways and windows, not through
// the walls) it gets nothing from the enclosed day floor either. What is left is `interiorAmbient`.
//
// MEASURED, the Lion's Pride Inn's front vestibule (`benilla-extract wmolights`, 2026-09-12). It is
// group `g0`, the WMO's only TRANS-batch group, and it hangs off the end of a CHAIN of doorways:
// porch `g11` --p0--> `g0` --p1--> `g1` --p2--> the hall `g5`, where the ten MOLT fixtures live.
// No fixture CONTAINS-claims g0 or g1; both rooms are lit, if at all, by portal hops. And the hops
// have run out by the time they reach p1: the nearest fixture claiming g1 (L2, 9.0 yd from p2)
// carries 2.6 yd of unspent reach past p2's own 3.2 yd of doorway slack, and p1's centre is 5.8 yd
// from p2's — so every claim weight at p1 is EXACTLY 0. The vestibule's budget there is the bare
// `interiorAmbient x interiorGain` = 0.0075, i.e. `1 - exp(-0.0075 x 2.5)` = **0.019 x tex**, while
// the `trans_night_floor` bake share renders the same planks at **0.324 x tex**: a flat grey band
// seventeen times its own neighbour, which is what the owner photographed at 20:50 and 23:59.

// THE FIX, and it is the owner's own principle stated as a light: a doorway between two rooms
// TRANSMITS. Stand an ordinary interior-lane point light IN such a portal, claiming both rooms, and
// give it every frame [`BLEED_K`] times the irradiance the BRIGHTER side has at the portal plane.
// Each room then reads a fraction of its neighbour AT the threshold (so nothing steps across the
// doorway) and falls off inward on the room lane's own profile (so it is a doorway's spill, not a
// second candle).
//
// **IN the doorway, not on the dark side of it, and that is the whole direction rule.** The obvious
// design stands the fixture inside the darker room and points it at the lit one — but which room is
// darker is not a fact about the building, it is a fact about the HOUR. At midnight the inn's
// vestibule takes light from the hall through p1; at noon the porch's own DAYLIGHT fixture lights
// the vestibule through p0 and the flow reverses, g0 into g1, which is exactly the owner's "by day
// only doorways admit light". A fixture standing on one side would have to be moved, and a light
// that moves through a wall when a cloud passes is worse than the seam it fixes. An APERTURE has no
// side: it sits in the hole, it is claimed by both rooms, and only its INTENSITY and COLOUR move —
// it carries whichever neighbour is brighter this frame, in that neighbour's own hue, and the
// direction reverses without anything moving. The cost is that the brighter room also gains a
// doorway glow (bounded at `BLEED_K` of what it already has there, falling off within a yard or
// two), which is what a lit doorway looks like anyway.
//
// IT IS THE SAME ENTITY SHAPE as a daylight fixture, and it carries [`DaylightFixture`] as its
// marker for exactly that reason — three exclusions ride on that component and none of them wants
// re-deciding here: `benilla_app::torch_shadow` refuses it as a cube-shadow caster
// (`Without<DaylightFixture>` — a 6 yd-wide doorway is not a point source), the packer skips
// `interiorGain` on it (`Has<DaylightFixture>`, and this module folds that gain into the TARGET
// already, so packing it again would dim the doorway twice), and it is neither a
// [`super::SyntheticFireLight`] (no `fireLightGain` over it) nor a [`super::FlameFlicker`] (a
// doorway does not wobble). [`BleedFixture`] beside it carries what is bleed-specific — the two
// rooms and the portal plane — and doubles as the query filter that keeps the two per-frame
// systems' `PointLight` access disjoint.
//
// NO FEEDBACK, ONE LEVEL. A bleed must not read another bleed as if it were a candle, or a run of
// doorways would ring up without bound. But refusing outright breaks the very case this exists for:
// the inn's vestibule is TWO doorways from the hall, so a p1 bleed that cannot see the p2 bleed sees
// nothing at all. So [`update_bleed_fixtures`] runs the evaluation TWICE in one system over its own
// local arrays: pass A lights every bleed from the REAL fixtures only, pass B re-lights each one
// from the real fixtures plus the PASS-A value of any OTHER bleed standing in the room being
// sampled. That is exactly one level of chaining, it resolves inside a single frame (no cross-frame
// accumulation), and the order the bleeds happen to be queried in cannot change the answer.
