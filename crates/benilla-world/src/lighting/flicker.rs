//! MONKEY (flame flicker): the per-light brightness wobble that makes a fire read as FIRE.
//!
//! Every flame in the world is a CONSTANT today. An authored M2 light block is sampled at its first
//! animation key and never again (the tracks are read once at bake), and a light SYNTHESISED from a
//! flame emitter ([`benilla_formats::fire_light`]) has no track at all — it is one number off an
//! intensity rung. So a wall torch, a candelabra and a bonfire all light their room with the
//! steadiness of a light bulb, which is the one cue that reads as "this is not fire".
//!
//! The fix is CPU-side and costs nothing, because of where it lands: `build_light_data` repacks the
//! whole point table into the storage buffer every single frame anyway (it re-sorts by camera
//! distance), so a per-light multiplier folded in at pack time is one hash and three sines per
//! packed entry — a few hundred flops for the whole table — and zero extra GPU work, zero extra
//! bandwidth, and no new `LightStd430` lane. Nothing is written back onto the `PointLight`
//! component, which is what keeps the flicker out of every OTHER consumer of that intensity:
//! `torch_shadow`'s caster ranking and hysteresis read the component and therefore still score the
//! UNMODULATED intensity, so a flame breathing at 5 Hz can never make a shadow map thrash in and
//! out of its slot.
//!
//! **What it must not be.** The failure mode has a name here — the "epileptic imp", the carried
//! light whose shadow slot toggled at frame rate (see `benilla_app::entities::carried_light`'s
//! stability note). A flicker that reads as a DISCO rather than as a flame is worse than no flicker
//! at all, so the waveform is built to be band-limited by construction rather than tuned by eye:
//!
//! * **Amplitude is small and ordered by mass.** A candle is a thumbnail of burning gas that a
//!   draught can visibly bend (±12%); a bonfire is a cubic yard of it with a thermal time constant
//!   (±6%). Ordering the rungs candle > torch > brazier > bonfire is the whole of the "plausible"
//!   claim — the big fires are STEADIER, not just slower.
//! * **Frequency is bounded, and the fast partials carry the LEAST weight.** Three sines spread
//!   across the kind's band, weighted `0.42 / 0.28 / 0.18` low→high, so the slowest partial
//!   dominates the eye's impression and the peak slew is roughly half what the top of the band
//!   would allow ([`FlameKind::max_rate`] states the bound the test asserts).
//! * **Weights sum to exactly 1**, so the excursion can never exceed the stated amplitude even when
//!   all four terms align, and every term is zero-mean, so the MEAN multiplier is exactly 1.0 and
//!   the room's tuned exposure ([`super::DynamicInteriors::exposure`]) is untouched.
//!
//! It is a function of ABSOLUTE time and a per-light seed only: frame-rate independent (the same
//! wall clock gives the same brightness at 30 fps and 240), deterministic, and — because the seed
//! hashes the light's own position — never in sync between two candles on the same table.
