//! The per-instance `MeshTag` channel: the one home of its bit layout and its writer protocol.
//!
//! Every `WowModelMaterial` submesh carries a Bevy `MeshTag`, a `u32` the shader reads per
//! instance. Bits 31 and 30 are flags ([`HIGHLIGHT_BIT`], [`INTERIOR_FOG_BIT`]), masked off before
//! the payload decodes. In the payload the rig and alpha fields mean the same in every mode, and
//! the bits between them switch meaning on material state:
//!
//! - Rig field (bits 19..=29): the instance slot into the shared buffer's slot-keyed regions, `0`
//!   for none. The vertex stage reads the skin palette with it ([`crate::rig_palette`]) only under
//!   `WOW_RIG_SKIN`, which comes from the mesh's own joints; the fragment stage reads the body tint
//!   ([`crate::instance_tint`]) for every part. Every part carries its unit's slot, so a tinted
//!   unit tints whole (an attached model inherits its parent CM2's colours, `0x714000`); worn gear
//!   owns a rider slot and takes the tint and the straddle waterline through its `ParentModel`
//!   chain. Written at spawn ([`rig_bits`]) and carried by every writer but [`with_rig`].
//! - Alpha (bits 0..=5): the fade alpha, multiplying the cutout alpha. A whole payload of `0` is
//!   the untagged, opaque sentinel.
//! - Exterior payload (the default): bits 6..=13 are the ground-shade byte (`0` lit, `255` fully
//!   MCSH-shadowed), mixing the batch's lit sun level toward the shaded one (`wow_model.wgsl`).
//!   Entities ramp it ([`crate::entity_shade`]); statics leave it `0` and shade per material
//!   (`sun_scale.x`). Bits 14..=18 are reserved.
//! - Interior probe slot (an interior M2 prop or entity: interior material, `model_flags.z` set,
//!   not a WMO): bits 6..=18 are the SH-probe table slot ([`crate::lighting::PropProbes`]).
//!   [`probe_bits`] always carries a non-zero alpha, so slot 0 is valid.
//!
//! The writers, deconflicted by field and by order:
//!
//!   Written ONCE at part spawn ([`rig_bits`]); every runtime writer below preserves it by
//!   construction (the `with_*` accessors carry bits the writer doesn't own). 11 bits ⇔
//!   [`MAX_RIG_SLOTS`] concurrent instances.
//! - **Alpha** (bits 0..=5, BOTH payload modes): the fade alpha as a 6-bit fraction (`63` =
//!   opaque), multiplying the cutout alpha. 64 steps is past perceptual for the sub-second fade
//!   ramps that write it (it was u16 pre-0720 — the rig field bought its bits from here). A whole
//!   payload of `0` is the shader's *untagged ⇒ opaque* sentinel, so the alpha field is never
//!   legitimately `0` — a true zero alpha writes `1` (≈0, invisible) instead ([`alpha_bits`]).
//! - **Exterior payload** (the default): bits 6..=13 carry the **ground-shade byte** (`0` = lit,
//!   `255` = fully MCSH-shadowed): the per-instance mix from the batch's lit sun level toward the
//!   shaded one (`wow_model.wgsl`). Entities (units/players/GameObjects) ramp it per frame
//!   ([`crate::entity_shade`]); statics (doodads/props) leave it `0` — their shade is the
//!   per-material selector (`sun_scale.x`). Bit 14 is the **MATTE-INDOOR flag**
//!   ([`MATTE_INDOOR_BIT`], MONKEY torch shadows Phase 3A): the classifier's `Matte` law — an
//!   entity standing INDOORS whose material nonetheless stays in exterior mode (day/night, no
//!   bake). `wow_model.wgsl` routes such a part to the dynamic-interior lane on it, so a unit
//!   whose verdict flickers `Bake`↔`Matte` at one spot keeps its lane. Bits 15..=18 are the
//!   **lane weight** ([`LANE_MASK`], MONKEY portal lane fade): a 4-bit crossfade from the
//!   exterior result (`0`) to the room result (`15`), so an entity walking through a portal
//!   blends between the two lanes over the anchor's ramp instead of popping in one frame. It is
//!   meaningful only alongside bit 14 — [`with_matte_indoor`] writes the pair, and the shader
//!   mixes by it.
//! - **Interior probe slot** (interior M2 props/entities — material in interior mode,
//!   `model_flags.z` set, not a WMO): bits 6..=18 carry the SH-probe TABLE SLOT (see
//!   [`crate::lighting::PropProbes`]; 8192 slots = 13 bits), alpha and rig ride their fixed
//!   fields — so a fade (the self-avatar zoom feather, a despawn ramp) and the skin palette both
//!   compose with the slot through the accessors instead of clobbering it (the pre-0355 layout
//!   put the slot in the alpha bits: a feathering indoor character lost its probe AND read shade
//!   byte 0 = the lit exterior intensity — the director's "light jumps outdoor when I zoom in").
//!   Slot 0 is a valid payload: [`probe_bits`] always carries a non-zero alpha field, so the
//!   shader's untagged-⇒-opaque `0` sentinel never fires for these.
//!
//! A new payload writer claims reserved bits through a typed accessor here, never a whole-payload
//! convention of its own. Bit 31's one writer, `target::highlight::apply_highlight`, runs in
//! `PostUpdate` after the `Update` payload writers, which drop the flag, and re-asserts it.
